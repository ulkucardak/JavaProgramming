/*
For compiler one of the most important task is balanced brackets
    * Create a method that will accept a String of brackets. Determine if the brackets are balanced.
    Brackets are balanced if the closing bracket matches the opening one.

    Hint: Use HashMap for the bracket pairs and Stack to help keep track of which opening brackets have been seen and need to be closed

    Ex: {([])} -> balanced
        {[(])} -> not balanced
